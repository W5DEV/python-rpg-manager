# RPG Manager

## Description

This project is maintained and developed by [John Larson (W5DEV)](github.com/W5DEV). Please contact me via my website at [W5DEV.com](https://w5dev.com) for any questions or concerns, or issues with this project.

This project is a text-based RPG game engine, which will allow players to create and manage their own characters, and play through a series of stories and adventures.

This game is currently in the engine/rules development phase. The game is being developed in Python, and will be loosely based on rules commonly found in popular RPG games.

Any contributions are welcome, and can be made by forking the repository and submitting a pull request. It should also be noted that while in the engine/rules development phase, the code can and will be constantly changed and refactored as improvements and optimizations are made.

The project development is being broken up in phases:

- Phase 1: Character Creation
- Phase 2: UI Implementation
- Phase 3: Combat
- Phase 4: Leveling Up
- Phase 5: Testing
- Phase 6: DM Mode
- Phase 7: Connectivity

Each phase will be broken down into smaller tasks, which will be tracked in the project board. To gain access to the project board, please contact me at [W5DEV.com](https://w5dev.com).

Current phase ***Phase 2: UI Implementation***.

## Features

- Character Creation: The player will be able to create their own character, choosing from a variety of classes, races and abilities.
- Familiar Rules: The game is based on the rules of popular tabletop role-playing games, so players who are familiar with the game will feel right at home.
- (Planned) DM Mode: The game will feature a Dungeon Master mode, which will allow users to create enemies, manage players and create encounters.
- (Planned) Connectivity: Share your characters with others for integrated use in DM mode.

## Current Status

Currently, the game is in the early stages of development, focusing on UI optimization and selectable options.
